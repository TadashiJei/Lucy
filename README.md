## üíª Usage

Clone this repository or download and extract the script file
Open the terminal and navigate to the script directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/TadashiJei/Lucy.git

Run the script with the following command:

    ./lucy_installer.sh

The script will install all necessary dependencies, download and install the Fluxion tool, and start the Fluxion tool. (Ubuntu chroot)

## :book: How it works
* Scan for a target wireless network.
* Launch the `Handshake Snooper` attack.
* Capture a handshake (necessary for password verification).
* Launch `Captive Portal` attack.
* Spawns a rogue (fake) AP, imitating the original access point.
* Spawns a DNS server, redirecting all requests to the attacker's host running the captive portal.
* Spawns a web server, serving the captive portal which prompts users for their WPA/WPA2 key.
* Spawns a jammer, deauthenticating all clients from original AP and luring them to the rogue AP.
* All authentication attempts at the captive portal are checked against the handshake file captured earlier.
* The attack will automatically terminate once a correct key has been submitted.
* The key will be logged and clients will be allowed to reconnect to the target access point.
